# Finance Engine in C++

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE)

## Overview

This project implements a **Bayesian Statistical Model** for **Quantitative Simulation** and **Risk Assessment** in finance. It uses **Monte Carlo simulations** to model uncertainty, predict stock outcomes, and provide insights for portfolio management. The Bayesian approach dynamically updates probabilities, optimizing risk management strategies.

## Features

- Bayesian statistical modeling for financial risk assessment
- Monte Carlo simulations to predict market trends
- Modular and scalable C++ codebase for flexibility
- Efficient and fast performance compared to Python implementations

Improvements to be made in the upcoming updates to make it more dynamic and resolved 
1.  **Dynamic Input Handling**: Currently, the program requires manual input for various parameters. To
Based on the output you provided earlier:

```
Episode 0 completed. Final portfolio value: 100168.91, VaR(5%): -0.0002, CVaR(5%): -0.0005
Episode 100 completed. Final portfolio value: 100716.62, VaR(5%): -0.0004, CVaR(5%): -0.0006
...
Episode 1200 completed. Final portfolio value: 100610.07, VaR(5%): -0.0003, CVaR(5%): -0.0005
```

Let's analyze these results:

1. Portfolio Performance: The agent is consistently maintaining and slightly increasing the portfolio value. Starting from an initial value of 100,000, it's showing modest gains (between 0.07% and 0.83% in the examples shown). This is positive, as it indicates the agent is not losing money and is making small, consistent profits.

2. Risk Measures: The Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) values are very low, indicating that the agent is taking minimal risk. This aligns with the small but consistent gains we're seeing.

3. Learning Progress: There isn't a clear trend of improvement over the episodes shown. The performance seems relatively stable across the 1200 episodes.

Given these observations, I wouldn't say the outputs are "wrong" or "not good." They show that your implementation is working and producing reasonable results. The agent is learning a conservative strategy that consistently preserves and slightly increases capital while minimizing risk.

However, there is room for improvement:

1. Limited Learning: The agent doesn't seem to be significantly improving its strategy over time. This could be due to reaching a local optimum or not exploring enough.

2. Conservative Strategy: While preserving capital is good, the gains are quite small. Depending on your goals, you might want the agent to take slightly more risk for potentially higher returns.

3. Exploration vs Exploitation: The consistent performance suggests the agent might be exploiting a safe strategy without exploring potentially better options.

To address these points without implementing the more advanced suggestions yet, you could try:

1. Increasing the number of episodes significantly (e.g., to 50,000 or 100,000) to give the agent more time to learn and potentially discover better strategies.

2. Adjusting the epsilon value in your epsilon-greedy strategy to encourage more exploration, especially in the early episodes.

3. Experiment with different initial values for your Q-table to see if it leads to different learned strategies.

4. If possible, run the simulation multiple times and average the results to get a more robust understanding of the agent's performance.

These adjustments might help you get more out of your current implementation before moving on to more complex modifications. Remember, the "goodness" of the results depends on your specific goals for this trading agent. If the goal is capital preservation with minimal risk, your current results are actually quite good. If you're aiming for higher returns and are willing to accept more risk, then there's room for improvement.
