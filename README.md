# Finance Engine in C++

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE)

## Overview

This project implements a **Bayesian Statistical Model** for **Quantitative Simulation** and **Risk Assessment** in finance. It uses **Monte Carlo simulations** to model uncertainty, predict stock outcomes, and provide insights for portfolio management. The Bayesian approach dynamically updates probabilities, optimizing risk management strategies.

## Features

- Bayesian statistical modeling for financial risk assessment
- Monte Carlo simulations to predict market trends
- Modular and scalable C++ codebase for flexibility
- Efficient and fast performance compared to Python implementations
